    <h1>Quick and easy french toast</h1>
    <h3>Wake up to an irresistibly delicious breakfast that's super quick and easy to whip up using a few basic ingredients you likely already have in your kitchen. 
        This French toast recipe soaks thick slices of bread in a mixture of milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and an egg before tossing each slice in a frying pan. 
        Fluffy and tender on the inside and perfectly golden-brown on the outside, making French toast is one of our favorite — and most indulgent! — breakfast dishes. 
        You can use any bread you have left over from the week to make this breakfast treat, but we especially love the density of sourdough, challah and brioche French toast. Drizzle with maple syrup and customize with different toppings like strawberries, blueberries, and honey butter for a scrumptious breakfast that’s perfect for Easter brunch.
